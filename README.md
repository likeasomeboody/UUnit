# UUnit
A testing framework designed for Unity C# with additional features.

The motivation for creating this is the lack of available functionality with Unity's regular testing tools that is readily available in most other testing frameworks. Though Unity testing is good for most situations, this project aims to make it complete.  

## Planned Features:
-	Standard Unit Tests
-	Coroutine Tests
-	Unity batch mode running
-	Code coverage assessment
-	Code coverage UI 
-	Cobertura code coverage report generation 
-	Editor and batch mode NUnit and JUnitreport generation 
-	Non-Unity coroutine test execution (Unity engine Mocking)
-	Scene test components
-	Scriptable Scene tests
-	Fluent Assertions 
-	Moq
